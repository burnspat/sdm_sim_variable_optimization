Here is the legend for the model names: 
V is for variable (listed and crosswalk below)
s is for scale (which is square focal mean in r raster package)
p is for power (which is the power to which the variable Vx and scale sx is raised)
c is coefficient (which is the GLM beta coefficient for that term)
